0.3 (unreleased)
----------------

- Nothing changed yet.


0.2 (2014-02-24)
----------------

- Make values not required.  Until now you could fake an empty values
  list by typing a space as value.  In some circumstances, next time
  you edited the configuration, you would need to do this again
  because the space was stripped.
